alarm_control_panel.py
----------------------
- take into account endity_id from service calls (what to do in MQTT case?)
- check how it works if HA restarts in triggered state (will it resume triggering? _lasttrigger?)
- Enable MQTT without HA restart/(WIP)
- validate MQTT using schema
- state[mode]xxx_time appear in yaml with (when that section edited via Settings) OR without quotes, investigate

Milestones
- remove obsolete enable_perimeter_mode attribute and perimeter_mode stuff from the code

KNOWN POTENTIAL ISSUES
- arm_xxx with open sensor (override), reboot HA -> will react to open sensor and trigger the alarm

panel.html
----------
- timer after clear code/restore persistence is incorrect
- warnings in JS console (about deprecated stuff)
- prev style buttons/code panel?
- use another way to find out the integration's entity_id (as someone can change name: in bwalarm.yaml and there is no panel_custom.yaml anymore!)
- service calls: this.platform hardcoded, change
- Beaware that html imports are deprecated and support will be removed: https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5144752345317376

Docs:
- add something like this about use cases: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/bwalarm-akasma74-edition/113666/222
- Video tutorial(s) that cover:
    some overal things; set pincode, how arm away/home works, show numpad on “frontend”/lovelace
    how motion sensors are handled (delay, trigger etc)
    how the motion sensors trigger a siren (when armed)
    how the motion sensors trigger a email or/and a notification when triggered)
    -reset alarm after it has been triggered

FRs:

- Is there a way to increase the keypad button size to approximately what it was in the “pre mwc-button”
- If we could get that override open sensors into the lovelace platform that would be amazing
